# Rules for uniformication
- You can bet only the lower part of the numbers, on streets. So that the numbers will always be in order.
    Ex. these two bets will become {"19-20-21-22-23-24":1,"21-20-19-24-23-22":1} => {"19-20-21-22-23-24":2}
- The numbers are in order. Starting with double zero, [00,0,1,2,3...36]
